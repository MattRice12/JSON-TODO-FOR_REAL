I should be able to request only the completed tasks through a non-CRUD route. (That means you should use your own name for that route. For example /tasks/completed)

I should be able to request only the incomplete tasks through a non-CRUD route.

I should be able to see all the tasks for a given list when I request a specific list.
/lists/1 would show the json of that list and an array of all the task objects that belong to that list.
